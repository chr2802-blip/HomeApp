# HomeHub

Lists, recurring tasks and recipes for a household. Multi-tenant: everything belongs to a
**home**, and people belong to a home. Next.js App Router, Prisma, Postgres, on Vercel.

Read this before changing anything. Most of what follows exists because the alternative
was tried and caused a bug.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # local dev server
npm run verify       # lint + types + all tests — what the pre-push hook runs
npm test             # vitest (unit + integration)
npm run e2e          # Playwright (builds the app first)
npm run db:studio    # browse the database
```

Integration and browser tests need the local Postgres: `docker start homehub-pg`.

## Conventions that are not optional

### Home-scoped data goes through `homeDb`

```ts
const lists = await homeDb(user.homeId).list.findMany({ orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" } });
```

`src/lib/home-db.ts` carries the home into every query against a home-scoped model
(List, RecurringTask, Recipe, Invite, User) and stamps it onto anything created. A query
that forgets the home returns nothing rather than another household's rows.

**Never hand-write `where: { homeId }` in a page or component.** A lint rule rejects
`prisma.list` and friends there. Use `prisma` directly only where crossing homes is the
point — the reminder job, the super admin's system view — and say so in a comment.

Permission checks live separately in `src/lib/access.ts`; `homeScoped` in
`src/lib/scoped.ts` fetches a single record and asserts access. `homeDb` does not replace
those — it removes the chance to ask the wrong question.

### Dates go through `src/lib/time.ts`

The household runs on one clock (`TIME_ZONE`, currently `Europe/Copenhagen`), never the
server's. Use `dueAtOn`, `dueAtDaysFrom`, `formatInZone`, `calendarDaysBetween`.

Never `new Date(...)` arithmetic, `getHours()`, or `toDateString()` for anything a person
sees. Those read the server's clock, which is UTC in production and something else on a
laptop — the same input then means different things in different places. Both test suites
run with `TZ=UTC` so this fails on the machine that wrote it rather than in CI.

### Form actions report what happened

Actions that read user input take `(previous, formData)` and return `ActionResult`:

```ts
export async function createThing(_prev: ActionResult, formData: FormData): Promise<ActionResult> {
  const form = readForm(schema, formData);
  if (!form.ok) return fail(form.error);
  ...
  return ok();
}
```

Validation uses Zod through `readForm` (`src/lib/form.ts`), so the wording a person sees
sits beside the field. **Never bail out with a bare `return`** — that closes the dialog as
though it saved. Actions that only act on an id (toggle, delete, complete) keep a plain
`(formData)` signature; there is nothing to report.

### Forms submit through `useFormAction`, not the `action` prop

`src/components/use-form-action.ts`. React 19 clears an uncontrolled form once its action
resolves, which on a *rejected* submission throws away everything the person typed. The
hook uses `onSubmit` so values survive an error; only a successful add to a list resets.

### Tests gate everything

`.githooks/pre-push` checks the change before it leaves: lint, types and unit tests
always; the integration and browser suites only when `src/`, `prisma/`, `tests/`, `e2e/`,
`scripts/`, a lockfile or a build config changed. CI runs the full suite regardless, and
`npm run build` runs the unit tests. Pushing to `main` deploys, so a failing suite must
not reach the remote.

Integration and E2E use **separate** databases (`homehub_test`, `homehub_e2e`), created
automatically. They truncate between tests, and refuse to run against a database whose
name lacks the right suffix.

A flaky test is worse than no test: it teaches everyone to press the button again. Fix the
race, do not add a timeout.

## Deployment

Only `main` deploys — `vercel.json` disables every other branch. **There are no preview
deployments**, deliberately: they ran migrations against, and served from, the production
database.

Production: **https://home-app-three-virid.vercel.app**. Other Vercel addresses for this
project are frozen snapshots of one build and will show stale commits forever. The
deployed commit is shown on **Admin → System**.

Migrations run inside the production build (`prisma migrate deploy`). A bad migration
therefore presents as a failed build, and there is no rollback path — worth changing if it
ever bites.

## Observability

**Admin → System** (super admin) shows database health, the reminder job's recent runs,
content totals and the slowest queries of the last day. Home admins see whether reminders
are reaching their own household.

The reminder job writes a row before it starts work, because a schedule that silently
stops looks exactly like a week with nothing due. `/api/health` gives an uptime monitor a
verdict anonymously, and the detail behind it to a caller presenting `CRON_SECRET`.

Request failures are logged as JSON lines via `src/instrumentation.ts`, not stored.
Queries over `SLOW_QUERY_MS` are recorded and pruned after a week.

## Traps worth knowing

- **Hydration has no DOM signal.** A widget's markup looks identical before and after
  React attaches listeners. Browser tests of interactive widgets must wait on something
  the widget itself emits — the drag tests wait on dnd-kit's announcements.
- **Prisma accepts a non-unique field in `where`** on `findUnique`, `update` and `delete`,
  returning null or `P2025` on mismatch. That is what makes `homeDb` work everywhere.
- **`vercel.json` is schema-validated.** An unknown key can fail the deploy; keep
  explanations in the README.
- **On Windows, `npx.cmd` cannot be spawned without a shell.** Invoke a CLI's entry point
  with `node` instead (see `tests/setup/global.ts`).
- **`npm audit` reports build-time-only advisories** in Prisma's CLI and Next's PostCSS.
  `audit fix --force` downgrades Prisma and breaks the build. Leave them.

## Working style

Open a branch, keep `npm run verify` green, and open a PR rather than pushing to `main`.
Explain in the PR what changed and why, and flag anything you decided rather than knew.
